## Currency Converter CLI Project
This is a simple command-line tool for currency conversion.

## Usage
- Upon running the script, you'll be prompted to select your base currency, target currency, and enter the amount you wish to convert.
- The tool will then calculate and display the converted amount.

## Supported Currencies
Currently, the tool supports conversion between the following currencies:

- PKR (Pakistani Rupee)
- USD (United States Dollar)
- GBP (British Pound Sterling)

## Conversion Rates
Conversion rates are hardcoded within the script for simplicity. In a real-world scenario, you would fetch these rates from an external API.
